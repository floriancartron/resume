## Work Experience

### Prestashop — DevOps / Platform Engineer
*September 2025 – Present*

Ensuring reliability of the infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions).

**Kubernetes platform & GitOps:**

- Led the migration to GitOps with ArgoCD (ApplicationSets, App of Apps) to streamline deployment of existing and new projects.
- Enforced 12-factor build practices to enable environment promotion across clusters.
- Implemented Crossplane to provision GCP resources (service accounts, Workload Identity, etc.) directly from Helm charts, removing standalone Terraform config for these objects.
- Deployed self-hosted Renovate for frequent dependency updates; extended the practice from the infra team to dev teams.

**Observability:**

- Reworked Grafana dashboard deployment using ArgoCD, with templating and provisioning through ConfigMaps.

**FinOps:**

- Implemented Custom Compute Classes to define Kubernetes node preferences and optimize compute costs.
- Deployed Kube-Green to automatically stop non-critical workloads at night.
- Rightsizing of Kubernetes workloads (requests/limits tuning).
- Automated Cloud SQL instance shutdown during off-hours.

**Migration:**

- Migrating legacy VM workloads to GKE.

**Stack:** Google Cloud, Google Kubernetes Engine, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Crossplane, OpenTelemetry, Terraform, Terragrunt, Cloudflare, Kyverno
